## Story of The Game:
The world has been dying for years, a wolf came from afar years ago, and has been plaguing the Whispering Woods ever since. He poisoned its waters and degraded its soil, so he has power over the forest and can torment it, in order to avenge his lost daughter who disappeared there. There is a legend among the beings who inhabit the Whispering Woods that one day there will come the heir to the soul of the forest, and he will drive out the wolf and restore the forest to its former strength. One stormy night, an owl sits in its shelter, and sees a shooting star, which falls a short distance from her. She quickly runs after it and notices that it's not a star but a soul and brings it to her house, where she lets it recover for another day. The soul had wandered out of the neighbouring forest and wanted to escape from it, but couldn't because of the thorns and filthy water everywhere. It hears out story about the forest from the owl known as Ori. It decides to help the forest so it can get home. It sees the state the Whispering Woods are in, all dried up and almost lifeless. When asked, Ori shares what to do. It has to restore the water and bring nutrients to the forest. The soul becomes the hero of our story and goes to the Eastern Forest, where he solves two puzzles and obtains a handle and a stick, which he uses to make a lever needed to run the old mill that will restore the flow of water, make it potable again. The inhabitants notice the change and they give him advice that there's a cave where is a hidden sword. The hero goes to retrieve it and follows Ori, while he learns that there are nutrients in the Western Forest, which are divided into three parts. The hero sets off to collect them, but encounters two types of enemies. There are big bugs that run fast but are clumsy, and small mosquitoes that attack quickly but can be killed easily. After getting the three parts and combining them, the hero restores the forest. The wolf notices him and kidnaps his savior, Ori, and takes her up a tree, where he wants to to kill her. Down below, one of the creatures quickly gives him a fireball, which he must put down the wolf's throat in order to finish him. He climbs up as fast as he can, overpowers the wolf, but in the end he doesn't eliminate him, because the wolf realizes his weakness and runs away from the woods, and the Whispering Woods regain their former glory
